People always moan at me about how hard money is to make.

And my usual response is:

“What have you tried?”

They typically reply...

"I read this book, looked into this, and I’ve been planning, blah, blah, blah"

They don’t understand.

Talking isn’t doing.

It won’t get you anywhere.

The only way to make money is to DO stuff.

When I was broke I tried EVERYTHING.

Selling TV Ads, selling Aloe Vera, fighting, there’s nothing I wouldn’t do.

I tried everything, failed multiple times, and then something worked and I got PAID.

Action is the only way you’ll progress.

Not talking.

Not planning.

And not reading books.

But you gotta know HOW to move and understand certain principles.

No matter the business.

And no matter how much capital you’ve got starting off with.

Once you start DOING shit?

You quickly realize money is EVERYWHERE.

You just got to collect it.

Combine that with the mindset to achieve ANYTHING?

You will quickly become a money-making machine.
