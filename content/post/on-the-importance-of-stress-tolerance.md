Stress tolerance is a great indicator of future success

Most people are having mental breakdowns due to a break-up or some minor thing that's not working in their business

While the elite of the elite are super relaxed and smiling even when everything is chaotic around them.

Think of people like Jake Paul, Tate, Mcgregor, Trump

They've constantly bombarded with death threats, so many haters, so many powerful enemies who are trying to destroy them, all the paranoia

Although their life is difficult and there's so much pressure they're still winning.

High level people perform regardless of what's happening around

The weak get depressed when someone talks bad about them

Choose where you wanna be

Don't lose your focus over bullshit

**Attack. Perform.**
